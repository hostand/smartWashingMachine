# From Dumb to Smart Washing Machine - Home Assistant

![dumb-washing-machine](wm.png)

Use a power plug with an energy consumption monitor and Home Assistant to transform your dumb washing machine into a "smart" one with a bunch of informative features. Basically, we will use the measurements of power drawn by the washing machine connected in a smart plug (WIFI) with power monitoring. Depending on power drawn we can determine with some accuracy the status of the washing machine and automate some stuff.

Before start you will need this:

- A Washing Machine (Serious dude!?)
- A Smart Power Plug (WIFI) Tuya/SmartLife Compatible
